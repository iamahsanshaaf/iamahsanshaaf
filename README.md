### 🏗 Architecture & Engineering Philosophy
I don't just "write code"; I build modular, testable systems that last. 
- **State Management:** Expert in **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** for predictable UI states and **MVVM** for modularity.
- **Dependency Injection:** Strict adherence to DI (Hilt/Swinject) to ensure code testability.
- **Performance:** Deep experience in profiling memory, optimizing Jetpack Compose recompositions, and reducing app launch times.
- **Reactive Programming:** Leveraging **Kotlin Flow** and **Swift Combine** for seamless data streams.
